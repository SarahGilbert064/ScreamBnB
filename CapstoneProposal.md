## Capstone Proposal

#### Name of Student: Sarah Gilbert

#### Name of Project: ScreamBnB

#### Project's Purpose or Goal: 
ScreamBnB is a hotel, motel, and BnB booking sight for those who want to spice up their trip! Are you a fan of history, horror, and true crime? Then you have found your accommodation booking sight, as we only deal with haunted places! This application will give users access to accommodations all throughout the USA and will include the history and personal accounts of those who have braved a night in these spooky places. If available, there will also be information on tours for those who really want to get to know where they are sleeping. Users will be able to search by location and will have access to accommodations, at all budgets and price levels.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* User authenication for those who want to leave a review on their stay and/or add to the fanbase 'suggestions' list
* Built in database with information on haunted places, their history, location, and reviews
* Information/links for history and booking a stay

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* ReactJS 
* Redux
* Bootstrap
* NoSQL
* Firebase

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Access to videos of 'hauntings' when applicable
* Create a saved 'favorites' list for users

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
